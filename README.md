Hello! This is my selfbot. It is based off of RhythmBot Selfbot edition by Jake Gealer. Show him some love! (https://github.com/Gamerhythm/Rhythmbot-Selfbot-Edition) Here's how to set this up:
1. Download and install Python 3.6 with pip.
2. Download ConnerSelf.py and put it in a folder.
3. Make a blank .txt file in that folder. Name it "token.txt"
4. Put your Discord token in token.txt
(To get your token, log into Discord, hit ctrl+shift+i, look for "Application [you may need to hit the >> button to see it], expand "local storage" in the storage tab, and select the Discord URL. Find where it says "token" and copy the value. Remove the quotation marks in token.txt otherwise it will not work)
5. Save token.txt.
6. Run ConnerSelf.py
7. Profit
For a list of commands, type "..help" in any Discord server once it is running.
You will know it is running when you see this appear in the Python console:
#-----------------------
#logged in as: (Your Discord username#Your 4-digit Discord discriminator)
#(Your account ID)
#----------------------- 
(You won't see the hashtags, those are just there so the formatting is not borked) 

The bot prefix is ".."
The "..help" embed is kinda messy, but it is readible.
I'd like to thank Jake Gealer for making the base of this, Kelwing for the embed code, and SSL (discord.gg/ssl) for introducing me to such a wonderful platform. 
For support, join my WIP Discord (discord.gg/usWqeSF) and go to #Conner_selfbot_support. I am The meme man (Conner)#9719 on Discord.
